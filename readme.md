Name:
	bmsort.pl - sorts a Netscape/Mozilla bookmark file

Usage:
	bmsort.pl options

Options:
	-U : Sort by url. Default is to sort by title + url.
	-f : Sort with folders first. Default is sorting with urls first
	in a (sub)folder.

Bugs:
	None known

Notes:
	I have had this idea since Netscape removed the sort function from
	their bookmark manager. I had used another utility, Bookmark Magic,
	but it was a MS-Windows only program.

	This program works by creating an associative array, with the key
	being generated by a concatenation of keys indicating folders, urls,
	separators, end of folders, and the folder names, urls or titles and
	urls, to keep bookmarks with the same title from being overwritten.
	I changed the key to url + title after discovering missing bookmarks
	during testing.
